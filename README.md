# Cake Dawn

Cake Dawn is an enhanced version of Shopifyâ€™s leading free theme, Dawn, designed to provide additional functionality to merchants who sell cakes. Key features of Cake Dawn include:

- **Infinite Scroll:** allow customers to browse through cakes and blog posts without interruption from pagination links
- **Dawn Theme Features:** use all of the existing features of Dawn version 12.0.0

### Coming Soon:
- **Cake-Specific Customizations:** allow customers to customize their cake orders by adding a custom cake message and their nut allergy/alcohol syrup preferences
- **Product Minimums:** set minimum order quantities at the product level to ensure that smaller baked goods, such as cupcakes, can be made in batches
